I'm a second year graduate student in the pure math PhD program at the University of Minnesota. I immigrated from the West Coast, where I grew up in Salem, Oregon before attending Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon. When I'm not doing math, I enjoy playing jazz piano, backpacking, and running. I know how to juggle.
