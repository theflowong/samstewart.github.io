## Podcast
I co-host a podcast about math with a fellow graduate student Jorin Schug (of Swarthmore fame). Our goal is to show just how funny and approachable math can be.

1. [Episode #1](https://soundcloud.com/samuel-stewart-61960400/this-mathematical-life-episode-one)
In this (somewhat pretentious) Numberphile video, a couple of physicists argue that
\[
	1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + \cdots = -\frac{1}{12}.
\]
Is this apparently nonsensical statement true? If so, how? We argue about math, British accents, and Katie Perry in this (clearly too long and introspective) humorous rant.
