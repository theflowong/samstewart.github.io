In English, the numbers below ten are given in words as follows
\\[
	\textrm{one}, \textrm{two}, \ldots, \textrm{nine}.

\\]

For efficiency, when we want to talk about numbers outside the teens, for example the number 22, we re-use the words for the numbers below ten and attach the prefix "twenty" to the base word two. So the number 22 becomes twenty-two. In this way, 32 becomes thirty-two, 42 becomes forty-two, etc.

This linguistic structure is based upon an underlying mathematical structure. Namely, that our ancestors counted in base ten. In base ten, when we have exhausted all ten digits, we add a new prefix. For example, we have
\\[
	\ldots, 28, 29, 30, 31, \ldots
	\\]

In the above sequence, when we transitioned from 29 to 30, we reset the trailing 9 to 0 and changed the leading number from 2 to 3.

This is quite an efficient representation because we need only nine distinct digits (or equivalently nine distinct words) to represent any number. 

The French language reveals that at some point the French might have counted in base 20, and *not* base 10. Why?

In French, the numbers below ten mirror our structure and are given by
\\[
\textrm{un}, \textrm{deux}, \textrm{trois}, \ldots, \textrm{neuf}.
\\]

The language has a similar structure for re-using words for higher numbers. The number 19 is "dix-neuf" and 21 is "vingt-et-un" (the prefix "vingt" is the number twenty).

Since "quarante" is forty, then 42 is "quarante-deux" as you would expect. However, something interesting happens at 60. The number 62 is "soixante-deux", 63 is "soixante-trois", etc. One would expect that 71 is "[some prefix]-un". Surprisingly, the number 71 is "soixante-onze" which translates to sixty-eleven. The number 72 is "soixante-douze" or sixty-twelve.  

This pattern continues until one hundred with the number 82 being "quatre-vingt-deux" which translates to four-twenty-two. 

This linguistic difference points to a base 20 representation. For example, in the case of 82 the French are imagining as $82 = 4*20^1 + 2$ ("quatre-vingt-deux") instead of $82 = 8*10^1 + 2$ ("huitante-deux").

We have ten fingers so base ten is a natural way to count. But we have twenty fingers and toes. Does counting in base twenty suggest that a culture's ancestors counted on their toes? Hard to say.
