Let's face it. There is only one outcome for a liberal arts graduate, and that is more school. The model appears designed to produce clones of professors. Indeed, the comedian Dave Barry agrees

`The idea is, you memorize these things, then write them down in little exam books, then forget them. If you fail to forget them, you become a professor and have to stay in college for the rest of your life.`

Essentially students who attend liberal arts colleges have a hard time forgetting things. And this is backed up by data (Harvey Mudd article). Small liberal arts schools graduate a disproportionate number of students who continue on to obtain PhDs. There are two possible reasons for this

1. Liberal arts students are smarter than everyone else and get PhDs without even trying.
2. Liberal arts students lack skills useful outside of academia.

I'm  a liberal arts student in math graduate school myself, so  I'll let you decide which possibility is more believable. As with all academic decisions though, let me remind you to choose the option that best fits your ego.

Assuming you go with the obvious choice of one, this article will list some hints for getting into a decent graduate program in mathematics. Keep in mind that these tips are my personal experience only. 

# Choose the Right Courses
We all know the point of liberal arts school, and graduate school in general, is to be a safe haven for the indecisive. In college, you spend the first year in near-constant existential angst and manage to take courses in every department. The second year, you take a year off and travel, eventually finding yourself. The third year is intense. The fourth year you take first year courses since you felt exhausted from all the self-discovery. 

The third year is intense because it's important. You need to spend your time wisely. For graduate school, the fourth year is not as important because graduate schools will only see your transcript from the past three years since you will be applying in December. You should take good courses during your fourth year, but you should take the core mathematical courses during your third year. You need to convince the admissions committee that you have the background necessary to succeed in their program. 

What should you take? At bare minimum, it's quite simple:
1. Year long course in algebra
2. Year long course in real analysis

Make sure these courses use the `right` books. Your real analysis course should use Rudin, and the algebra course should use Lang or Dummit and Foot. If they don't, make sure you study out of them. It's difficult to normalize material across undergraduate courses. A year long course in algebra might simply be an excursion in classifying symmetries of the plane, or a serious foundation. Graduate directors use the textbook as a measurement of a course's quality. This is particularly important if you attend a lesser-known liberal arts school. If the graduate admissions can't tell what your course covered, then they'll fall back to Subject GRE scores to compare you to other students. As a liberal arts student, and therefore lifetime anti-standardized test polemic, this is the last thing you want.

If your school doesn't have either of the courses, find one that does. Either a nearby state school, or, if you're one of the poor souls who finds themselves in the middle of cornfields (I'm looking at you Whitman), consider participating in an abroad program like Budapest Semesters in Math, or Math in Moscow. I spent a semester in the former, and it was a fantastic experience. These programs are well-known and offer graduate level courses. They will add credibility to your application.

# Get an Outside Approval Stamp 

# Do well on the Math Subject Test
I've realized that every liberal arts students  performs poorly on standardized tests. Why else would so many of them spend six years in PhDs trying to convince themselves otherwise? 

Despite this Achilles' heel, you should study seriously for the GRE exams. There are two exams: the general and the subject. The general exam is basically the SAT with a slightly harder math section. It is probably unnecessary to study too much for this, unless you are a non-native speaker. The math subject GRE, which most programs require, is quite difficult. As someone who scored poorly, despite studying, I suggest you take this exam twice: once in the spring of your junior year, and once in the fall of your senior year. If you mess up, you'll want another chance. This exam draws from all areas of mathematics, and tests both mathematical cleverness and speed. 

Personally, I'm not particularly clever or fast (just stubborn), so I just practiced by buying [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-GRE-Mathematics-Subject-Test/dp/0375429727) and cranking through problems until I developed a drinking problem. I recommend you do the same.

You might hear from peers that the subject GRE does not test your ability to do `real` math. That is irrelevant. A high school will not guarantee admission, but a low score (below 50%) is an easy rejection for most programs. While this might appear unfair, put yourself in the position of the admission committee. If you have several hundred applications, the best normalized score for comparing applicants is the subject GRE. Hence, while some schools (the University of Minnesota is one of them) basically ignore the subject GRE, many schools use it as a high-pass filter. 

Personally, I applied to ten schools and was excepted into two of them. Despite a stellar research record, a semester in Budapest, fantastic grades, and great letters, I'm guessing that my low subject GRE score meant some schools didn't open my application. 

# Meet in Person
If you can, try to arrange a meeting with someone related to the program. If the graduate school  is in the same state, consider driving over and speaking with the graduate director. Just like working at McDonalds, talking to the manager separates your name from a pile of similarly qualified applicants. 

If the graduate school is in another state, find a conference where you know they have a booth, write a travel grant at your university, and attend the conference. I followed exactly these steps and met our graduate director at the 2015 Joint Mathematical Meetings in San Antonio while giving a presentation. The personal connection certainly didn't hurt my admission chances.

# Don't Optimize for Grades
Admissions committees don't care about your grade in East Asian Poetry, Comparative Politics, or Jazz Appreciation. They care about your grades in Real Analysis and Algebra (see first section), and even then, they are looking for anything above a B. Perfectionism will waste your time. Instead of optimizing for a perfect GPA, spend the extra time taking graduate level courses in math. An imperfect grade in a graduate course is more meaningful than an A in an easy undergraduate course. Remember, admissions committees are not using your grades as indicators of your moral superiority, but as indicators of your ability to stay in the program. They want to avoid the expense and hassle of you failing to pass the preliminary exams.


# Apply to many schools
If each school has a $5\%$ chance of admitting you and the admissions process is independent for each school, than your probability of admittance follows a binomial distribution. If $A \dist \textrm{Binom}(n, .05)$ is the number of schools that admit you out of $n$, then see what happens as you increase $n$

(plot of 1 - .95^n against n)

In short, the more schools you apply to, the better. Obviously, you'll be constrained by budget, but your department might have some funds set aside to help students (mine did, thanks to a generous donor). I think ten schools is a good number. To give you perspective on the competitiveness of the admissions process, I applied to ten schools and only two admitted me despite a great GPA, great letters, one publication, three summers of research, a semester in Hungary, etc. 

Graduate admissions are pricey and you'll probably spend around a thousand dollars when the dust settles. But remember that this momentarily staggeringly large sum will drastically impact your earning potential and career options in the future. This is not the right context to save a few hundred dollars. 

# Follow your peers
Find out where good students from your department have gone. Academia works on handshakes and old reputations. If students from your school are successful in a well-known program, apply there.

More generally, look for programs that have lots of liberal arts students. Stalk the graduate student pages and see where they studied. If they went to schools similar to yours, [drop them an email](sams@umn.edu) and ask about the environment of the program. Finding programs with other liberal arts graduates is important for two reasons. First, you'll have a better social experience. Liberal arts students have varied interests compared to students who spent four years studying only math at large state schools. Second, applying to a program filled with other liberal arts graduates means you won't be competing with high-scoring foreign and state-school students who have only taken a math course since they were born.

# Apply to the University of Minnesota
While I wasn't paid (just coerced) to write this, you should consider applying to the University of Minnesota.
