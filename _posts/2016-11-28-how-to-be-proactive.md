In Richard Dawkin's *Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing* [4] an article by Erwin Schrodinger describes the reason why we struggle to be proactive:

> What is the characteristic feature of life?...When a system that is not alive is isolated or placed in a uniform environment...A permanent state is reached, in which no observable events occur. The physicist calls this the state of thermodynamical equilibrium, or of 'maximum entropy'

Essentially, being proactive means continually fighting against the desire to fall into an equilibrium state of non-information, or maximum entropy. Being proactive means producing order out of chaos. 

Just as living organisms create "negative entropy" to offset the positive entropy, being proactive creates "negative entropy" to offset apathy. One can be proactive in parallel directions: professionally and personally. Professionally, you must "make your own luck." Personally, you must "make your own life." I have tips for progressing in both directions (disclaimer: taking life advice from graduate students is **not** a good idea).

# Professionally

We all tend towards professional equilibria: we choose a career, we choose a company, we choose a network, and we choose a specialized role within the company. These steps are important. Bouncing between careers and companies is both existing and detrimental. However, the other extreme: no change, is equally damaging. 

To produce negative entropy professionally, you should always try to **learn something new**. If you already know one programming language, write your next project in a new one. If you already know one scientific technique, learn another approach.

This constant perturbation from the equilibrium allows you to **pursue new projects** that help you learn new skills. Do not wait for your superior to hand you something to do, start something on your own (e.g. a new client connection, refactoring an existing code base, etc.). Each project should push you just beyond your current knowledge level [5].

When you have reached a point where you are no longer progressing, you are at maximum entropy. Make a change. 

# Personally
Different though equally important, interpersonal relationships require time and investment. Organizing fun activities with friends and meeting new people requires planning and dedication. Having a core friend group is important for emotional support [2], but do not let that group become your social equilibrium. Push to meet new people and expand your world view.

Interacting with friends requires overcoming three barriers:
1. Natural inertia against doing *anything*
2. The ease with which technology can replace real interactions (for more on this, see [1], [2])
3. The American cultural barrier of socializing in large groups (see [3]).

When you have a core group of friends, it's easiest to socialize at the same bar every week. Why settle? Explore a new place or try an entirely new activity like going to a play or an art museum.

Maintaining existing social connections is difficult, but meeting **new** people requires overcoming another three barriers:
1. Social anxiety and learned "urban inattention" [2].
2. Lack of conversational skills.
3. Lack of hobbies outside of work.

Socializing with new people is difficult and requires some practice, though the payoffs are immense personally and professionally [6]. Develop a hobby and join a group (stamp collecting anyone?) then take a social risk and introduce yourself. Fight the social state of maximum entropy by *following up* and connecting your new friend with your existing network. It's surprising how few people are willing to do this.

# Conclusion
Personally, I often fall into equilibria, but I work hard to avoid them. As a graduate student, the social state of maximum entropy is hardest to avoid since avoiding professional equilibria is so demanding. The trick, I think, is to perturb away from the equilibria a non-zero amount; the actual magnitude doesn't matter. Remember, the real world is chaotic, so small perturbations can lead to surprising results [7].
