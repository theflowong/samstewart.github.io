Math has a problem: it is a culture of extremes. While proclaiming to be rational thinkers, mathematicians are prone to black and white thinking and the culture rewards it.

Of course, many of the problems I am about to describe are endemic to any competitive field (e.g. graduate school in general), but they manifest themselves particularly in math.

From a professional perspective, the tremendous ego of mathematicians (practically an entry requirement into the field) is representative of this dichotomous thinking. Mathematicians seem to believe that

1. Ability to manipulate symbols is connected to genius.
2. Mathematics is more valuable than all other fields of science due to its rigor.

Those who can perform symbolic manipulation are either *smart* or *incompetent*. Subjects are classified into "hard sciences" and "soft sciences" depending on the amount of mathematics involved. 

The reality is probably that:
1. Intelligence appears on many dimensions, and abstract problem solving can be done without the extensive use of symbols. 
2. Science progresses in many directions and mathematics is nothing but a good *tool* for careful organization. Clever experiments are responsible for the progress of much of modern physics.

The reward structure in math is also binary. One either proves a result or fails to prove a result. The preference for absolute rigor leaves little room for experimental math which is quickly labeled "applied." This narrow definition of truth pollutes the thinking and taste for problem solving. The result is that pure mathematicians carefully chose problems with a good chance of success, regardless of their relevance for applications.

From a personal perspective, the situation is even worse. Math is billed not as an *enhancement* of one's perspective on the world, but instead a *replacement* of one's perception of reality. Those who devote themselves entirely (at the expense of a reasonable sleep schedule, healthy diet, and regular exercise) are the idols of the field. 

Those who do attempt a personal life tend to attack their pursuits with the same obsessive abandon as they attack mathematics. Marathoners, power-lifters, and chess masters are common. I have heard from multiple colleagues that if you aren't pushing yourself to the limits, the activity isn't worth pursuing. The line between those who pursue math at the expense of a personal life, and those who throw themselves into self-improvement activities is as sharp as the distinction between the "hard" and "soft" sciences.

This culture of extremes is modern machismo nonsense and is a special case of the broader relentless American capitalist drive towards specialization. Some of the greatest mathematicians like Kolmogorov, Gauss, and Riemann were individuals with a staggering range of interests outside of pure math. 

The sad irony is that we have fallen prey to one of the oldest fallacies: confusion linear phenomena with nonlinear phenomena. Most mathematicians view the world as if it was a line with a max and a min. There are smart and dumb people, hard and easy subjects, dedicated and lazy researchers, etc. Most of these classifications probably follow more of a bell curve (we should take a hint from ourselves and respect the Central Limit Theorem!). 

Not only does this judgmental thinking limit our collaborations with other fields (I always hear "they can't speak our language!") and thus our selection of problems, it renders mathematics unwelcoming to those with different backgrounds and instead selects for a single personality type (introverted, thinking, judging). Diversity is more than a percentage of admitted students, it is building a culture that welcomes different perspectives, personalities, and life goals. If we continue perpetuating this culture of extremes, we will slowly isolate ourselves.
