					<div class="proof">
						Let $U = \{ (x, y) \in \R^2 \mid x &lt;  1 \}$ and $V = \{ (x, y) \in \R^2 \mid x &gt; -1 \}$. Then $U \cap V = \{ (x, y) \mid x \in [-1, 1] \}$. One can show that $U$ and $V$ are homeomorphic to $\R^2 \backslash \{ (0, 0) \}$. By constructing a deformation retract from $\R^2 \backslash \{ (0, 0) \}$ to $S^1$, we can see that
						\[
							\pi_1($\R^2 \backslash \{ (0, 0) \}$) = \pi_1(S^1) = \Z.
						\]
						Thus, $\pi_1(U) = \pi_1(V) = \Z$. Since $U \cap V$ is a convex set in $\R^2$, it is simply connected. Hence, in the statement of Van Kampen's Theorem, we have $N = 1$. Hence we can conclude from Van Kampen's Theorem that

				Calculate the homology groups of the torus $S^1 \times S^1$.

			</p>

			<p>
				<div class="main_idea">
					See <a href="what_is_homology.html">what is homology?</a>. Build the torus from one $0$-simplex, three $1$-simplices, and two $2$-simplices as follows
					<!-- insert diagram of simplicial complex of the torus. Label the vertices.-->
					The first homology group $H_0 = \Z$ since the space is connected. Since the torus is path connected, then $H_1 = \pi_1 = \Z \times \Z = \Z \oplus \Z$. Finally, we have $H_2 = \langle \lambda_1 - \lambda_2 \rangle / \langle 0 \rangle = \Z$. Hence, the homology is
				       \[
			       			H_k(T) = \begin{cases}
				 			\Z & \textrm{ if } k = 0, 2 \cr		
							\Z \oplus \Z & \textrm { if } k = 1
							\end{cases}
					\]
				</div>

				<div class="formalism">
					From first definitions alone we can compute the homology group. We start by computing the kernels and images of the boundary maps.
					\[
						\begin{aligned}
							\textrm{ker } \partial_0 &= \Z \cr	
							\textrm{img } \partial_0 &= 0 \cr	
							\textrm{ker } \partial_1 &= \langle a, b, c \rangle \cr	
							\textrm{img } \partial_1 &= \langle 0 \rangle \cr
							\textrm{ker } \partial_2 &= \langle \lambda_1 - \lambda_2 \rangle \cr	
							\textrm{img } \partial_2 &= \langle a + b - c\rangle 	 \cr
							\textrm{ker } \partial_3 &= 0 \cr	
							\textrm{img } \partial_3 &= 0\rangle 	
	
						\end{aligned}
					\]
					Note that $\textrm{ker } \partial_2$ because
					\[
						\partial_2(p \lambda_1 + q \lambda_2) = (p + q)(a + b - c) = 0.
					\]
					Since $a + b - c$ is a element of the basis $\{ a, b, a + b - c \}$ for $C_1$, then $p + q = 0$ so $p = -q$.	
					With this information we can compute the homology groups as follows
					\[
						\begin{aligned}
						H_0 &= \frac{\Z}{0} = \Z \cr
						H_1 &= \frac{\textrm{ker } \partial_1}{\textrm{img } \partial_2} = \frac{\langle a, b, c \rangle}{\langle a + b - c \rangle} = \Z \oplus \Z \oplus \Z / \Z = \Z \oplus \Z \cr
						H_2 &= \frac{\textrm{ker } \partial_2}{\textrm{img } \partial_3} = \frac{\langle \lambda_1 - \lambda_2 \rangle}{0} = \Z
						\end{aligned}		
					\]
					Thus, the homology of the torus is
				        \[
			       			H_k(T) = \begin{cases}
				 			\Z & \textrm{ if } k = 0, 2 \cr		
							\Z \oplus \Z & \textrm { if } k = 1

			</p>

			<p>
				<div class="main_idea">
					If such a map existed, then $r$ would be a retract from $D^n$ to $S^{n-1}$ which is unlikely. In the special case of $D^2$ to $S^1$, the problem is clear. The disk $D^2$ is simply connected while $S^1$ is not. The retraction includes $\pi_1(S^1) = \Z$ into $\pi_1(D^2) = 1$ which is impossible.

					The problem is that we cannot deform the space $D^2$ to $S^1$ without tearing it since $S^1$ has a hole while $D^2$ does not.
					<!-- insert diagram showing tearing of open sets -->

				<div class="formalism">
					Note: for the purpose of this proof, assume that all homology is reduced homology. That is, points have trivial homology (see Hatcher p. 110).
					<div class="proof">
						Assume towards a contradiction that there is a retraction $r : D^n \to S^{n - 1}$. Then we know that $r \circ i = \textrm{id}$ induces homomorphisms
						       \[
						       		(r \circ i)^* = r^* \circ i^* = \textrm{id}_{H_k(S^n)}

							so we have the following exact chain sequence
							<!-- exact sequence diagram connecting H_{n - 1}(S^{n- 1} \to H_{n-1}(D^n) \to H_{n - 1}(S^{n-1} -->
							But the composition $r^* \circ i^*$ cannot be equal to the identity because it factors through $H_{n - 1}(D^n) = 0$ with $H_{n - 1}(S^{n - 1}) = \Z$.

					For example, the degree of the identity is $1$, the degree of $z \mapsto z^2$ is two, the degree of a reflection is $-1$, and the degree of the antipodal map is $1$ (a rotation by $pi$, so homotopic to the identity). 
					</p>	
					<p>
					Most importantly, the maps $f$ and $g$ are homotopic if and only if they have the same degree. Hence, we can see that the fundamental group of $S^1$ is indeed $\Z$. This construction is earlier than the fundamental group description.  </p>

For this problem, we are looking for a two dimensional surface that has tangent vectors $X = \partial_x + y \partial_y + 2(x + y^2) \partial_z, Y = \partial_y + 2y \partial_z$ at every point.

						This statement is false in general. Consider the differential form
						\[
							\omega = dx \wedge dy + dz \wedge dt
						\]
						and note that
						\[
							\begin{aligned}
								\omega \wedge \omega &= (dx \wedge dy + dz \wedge dt) \wedge (dx \wedge dy + dz \wedge dt) &= 0 + (dx \wedge dy \wedge dz \wedge dt) + (dz \wedge dt \wedge dx \wedge dy) + 0
										     &= 2dx \wedge dy \wedge dz \wedge dt
							\end{aligned}
						where the last step followed since we preformed an even permutation on the elements in the term $dz \wedge dt \wedge dx \wedge dy$ to rewrite it as $dx \wedge dy \wedge dz \wedge dt$.
