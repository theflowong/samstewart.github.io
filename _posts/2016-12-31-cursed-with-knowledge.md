Knowledge is privilege and privilege is knowledge.

Is happiness inversely proportional to knowledge?

Cursed to know, cursed with sadness.

Curse to be ignorant, cursed with anger.

The happen medium of happiness and knowledge lies somewhere in the middle.

But once tasted, the forbidden apple cannot be undigested by pieces.
