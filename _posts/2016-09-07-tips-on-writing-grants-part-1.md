When you make someone feel smart, they feel smart, and like you better.

Get excited about your research.

Always get started early since the revision process is almost more important than the writing.

Be wary of anchoring in your own writing.

Develop and elevator pitch.

Convince the reviewers that your work is exciting and you're exciting.

Always read all the instructions and follow them exactly. No use complaining about bureaucracy since the reviewers are looking for reasons to reject.
