In a grant writing course that I'm taking, we discussed the following initial tips.

* When you make someone feel smart, they feel smart, and like you better.

* Make yourself and your  research exciting. Confident and well-organized is not enough.

* Having others read your grant is critical, so start early. Most academics procrastinate. 

* Give yourself time to set the writing aside to avoid becoming too tied to one approach.

* Develop an elevator pitch.

* Read all the instructions and follow them exactly.
