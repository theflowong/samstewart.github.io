# When is it hard to predict the future?

In our [first post]() about dynamical systems we discussed how we could use mathematics to predict the future. Instead of examining individual pendulum trajectories, we examined the *entire space* of trajectories (represented by a cylinder) so that we could see the long term patterns. We learned that most initial states (except pointing directly upward) end pointing straight down. In other words, we could predict the long term behavior fairly easily.

Imagine we make a small change and add a second pendulum to the first one. Play around with the new system. Can you predict how the trajectory will look after you release it?

Since we have two pendulums, we have another two degrees of freedom (position and velocity of the second pendulum) so our new space of possible configurations is $S^1 \times S^1 \ \R$. This is harder to visualize than the cylinder configuration space of the single pendulum since it is now a three dimensional object.
