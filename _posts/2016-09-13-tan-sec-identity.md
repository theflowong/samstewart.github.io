The trigonmetric functions are defined as ratios, so we can choose the scale any way we wish. That is, any right triangle can be rescaled so that it lies on the unit circle.

By definition, $$\sin \theta$$ is the ratio of the opposite over the hypotenuse. We are on the unit circle so the length of the hypotenuse is $$1$$, thus $$\sin \theta$$ is exactly the length of the opposite side. Likewise, $$\cos \theta$$ is the length of the adjacent side.

By Pythagorean's theorem, since $$\sin \theta$$ and $$\cos \theta$$ are legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse $$1$$, we have
\\[
	\sin ^ 2 \theta + \cos ^ 2 \theta = 1
\\]

But you also learn in calculus class that we have a similar identity for $\tan \theta$ and $\sec \theta$
\\[
	\tan ^ 2 \theta + 1 = \sec ^ 2 \theta
\\]
As [with the derivatives](way-to-remember-derivative-of-tangent), $\tan \theta$ and $\sec \theta$ appear to be related. Why?

The answer is geometric. Consider again the unit circle.

Notice that the two triangles share three common angles. This means that they are similar (one is a rotation and a scaling of the other).
