Einstein allegedly once said that 
`Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler`

Today, while sitting in a physics lecture, I realized this is particularly important in graduate school. As the professor paced in front of the board explaining the Principle of Least action, he suddenly stopped and said,

`When you are in graduate school, you must always search for the simplest way to do something. Because to get a PhD, you must do something complicated that no one has done before. If you are doing somthing complicated already for a problem in a first-year course, you have no hope of doing something complicated enough to graduate.` [1]

Keep simple concepts simple so that you can handle truly complicated problems. Everything appears complicated at the beginning, but since humans constructed every subject, there are always underlying principles or patterns.

This is obvious in science. At the heart of every great scientific discovery lies a simple idea. For example, in physics, the entire Newtonian revolution is based around three simple laws. In mathematics, all of Euclidean geometry boils down to five simple postulates. Science is structured around key ideas. 

In Newtownian mechanics, every complicated problem can be reduced to three simple laws. Understanding something is precisely this process: one reduces something complicated to something simple that one already knows. Thus, if you want to know many things, have a large knowledge of simple things. You will learn new ideas faster and more efficiently since you already have a big collection of related ideas. Indeed, Field's medalist Terry Tao notes that 

`The key, I think, is to find one or more efficient ways to internalise the subject â€“ either by using formalism, or geometric intuition, or physical intuition, or some other analogy or heuristic. Each mathematician has their own different way of doing this.` [2]

In jazz piano, I've noticed similar patterns. While one must master the mechanical skills of chords, scales, and rhythm, there are simplifying principles. For example, voice leading is a key skill for jazz musicians. Voice leading is the process of arranging chord movements so as to create smooth transitions and "lead" the melody. While there are hundreds of possible voicings for a given chord, every voicing boils down to a simple principle: the third and seventh notes move down by half-steps in a II-V-I progression. One can build more complicated chords via inversions and color notes, but the "leading" comes from the third and seventh. These notes (more than the root) are the *essence* of the chord.

Once I discovered this principle, learning new voicings, while technically difficult, became conceptually quite easy. As a result, I am able to learn more voicings faster since I don't have to waste mental effort.

As in math and music, in graduate school, quality, not quantity of work is important. Efficiency is key. Quality is important because the final goal is to do *one* thing that no one has done before, not to do many things that have already been done. Courses and exams exist to give you the simple perspectives of other great thinkers. The courses give you ways to efficiently internalize complicated ideas. But the courses alone won't earn you a PhD. A PhD requires that must combine many simple ideas to find a simple idea behind a complicated phenomena.
