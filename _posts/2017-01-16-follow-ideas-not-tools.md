A love of theory and fancy names presents a tremendous danger in mathematics. The temptation to pursue tools instead of problems is always present. Why is this trend problematic and what can we do about it?

Math is essentially a well-organized repository of ideas. Despite its apparently infinite extent, there are only a few core notions; the rest is calculation. To a novice, however, it is easy to mistake *computational tools* for one of these core ideas. 

The problem starts in college and continues into graduate school. In college, material like calculus is presented as a series of *tools*: computing derivatives of polynomials, finding volumes of surfaces of revolution, finding the velocity of a particle. The manic focus on computation obscures one of the two key ideas in the subject:
1. Dividing by something infinitely small (dx) is a valid operation
2. Finding area and finding velocity are opposite operations (Fundamental Theorem of Calculus)

Naturally, one has to learn how to compute, but currently the curriculum renders it easy to confuse a computation with a core idea. Taking the derivative of a nasty integral tells us little about the true meaning of the fundamental theorem of calculus.

The problem continues into graduate school where we win praise for "pure math." Theory building is necessary when organizing seemingly disparate results, but big names (co-adjoint representation of the Lie algebra) are again not the same as core ideas.

I'm currently learning Lie theory, and the two key ideas appear to be:
1. Symmetries reduce the dimension of your problem.
2. It suffices to study highly symmetric objects only locally.

Now a highly algebraic topic, Lie theory emerged from the need to solve differential equations. The extensive theory is merely a *tool* for simplifying complicated partial differential equations via symmetries. 

Like calculus, one must know how to use the tools in Lie theory via computation. However, one must avoid confusing the theoretical edifice (e.g. classification theorems) with the original problems (e.g. solving PDEs).

Pursuing tools for their own sake produces several problems. First, if you only understand the tools, but not their original motivation, you will be unable to distinguish between artificial and useful questions in the subject. Second, you might over-complicate the subject by introducing unnecessary abstraction and definitions. The goal is solve the original application in an elegant way. Too much problem (e.g. engineering) or too much elegance (algebraic topology) will limit your perspective.

The correct approach, I think, is to learn the basics of a theory, just enough to speak the language, and then find a good problem. The problem will guide you through the relevant results and keep your work in perspective. Don't find hammers and look for nails, find nails and build a better hammer.
