Every parent fears the question, ``where do babies come from?``  and likewise many students fear the question `where does the Fourier transform come from?`. In either case, the fear comes from having to generate complicated answers to simple phenomena. The wideranging usefulness of the Fourier transform gives the impression that it must also therefore be  `deep` or complicated. In actuality, [the most useful tools tend to be the most simple](why-are-simple-things-useful), and the Fourier transform is no exception. In this article, I want to show you the birthplace of the Fourier transform and the beautiful geometry behind it.

Just one might explain to a child that storks bring babies, you might also have learned that the Fourier transform of a function $$f : S^1 \to \C$$ is given by$$$$
$$
	\hat{f}_k = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_S^1 f(\theta) e^{-i \theta n} d\theta
	\label{eq:periodic_FT}
$$
And like the stork explanation, this deux ex machina explanation really does nothing beyond establish existence. All this tells us is that there is a mapping from $$L^2$$ to $$\ell^2$$.
