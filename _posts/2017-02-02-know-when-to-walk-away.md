Most meaningful tasks (e.g. relationships, creative projects, fitness goals, etc.) offer three main challenges:

1. It's hard to *start* something new. This stage has a high likelihood of failure.
2. It's hard to be *consistent* once you've begun a task. 
3. It's hard to know when to *give up*. 

Each of these stages require independent skill sets. Many of us find ourselves in stage three, which is an equilibrium state. It's this stage that I want to explore.

Given a baseline level of ambition and motivation, stages one and two are tractable. Most graduate students can start a new project, sign up for new classes, or meet new friends. Stage two follows and we can iterate on our project, do the homework for a class, and plan events with our new friends for several months. We're driven, we're organized, and we get things done. 

Speaking from personal experience, stage three is the death trap for most graduate students. I think the difficulty lies in a certain culture of *masochism*. There is a pernicious expectation that unless you're *suffering*, and I mean really suffering, you're not working on something hard or important. This idea is nonsense, of course, but does blind us to obvious red flags. Funding drops out of a project, a collaborator becomes non-communicative, a professor sets unrealistic homework expectations are all clear signs that it's time to quit. However, even as our own physical and mental health degrade, we will continue to work, convinced that the pain is only temporary.

Of course, part of a PhD is working on something challenging that requires persistence. One cannot simply quit when things become difficult. That said, we should be careful to distinguish those tasks that are actually *worth* our time. For me, I usually walk away too late and regret the wasted time later.

In addition to the peculiar "pain is gain" mantra in graduate school, we must fight the [sunk cost fallacy](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/03/25/the-sunk-cost-fallacy/) where we fallaciously assume that invested time is proportional to value. If something isn't fitting your key goals, or is an emotional drag, just walk away. As someone once told me, your life is only a tiny fraction of the time when you're dead. Don't waste a second of it.
