## What does it mean to "be smart"?
If you study a highly technical subject like math, computer science, or physics you regularly receive one of two responses when describing your interests:

1. I hate math.
2. You must be really smart.

Both of these comments are indicative of two disappointing facts:

1. The avergae person had a horrible high school experience with math.
2. The average person conflates mathematical intelligence with general intelligence.

The first problem probably causes the second, but math education is a problem too large for my experience (and for one post). If you're interested in a potential solution, see [1].

I want to address the second problem in the post.

## Intelligence is a Vector
People who believe mathematicians are "smarter" are employing a simplified definition of intelligence. In this model, intelligence is a _scalar_ quantity: it is one dimensional. You can assign each person a numerical score. Jason has an intelligence of 5 while Margaret has an intelligence of 4. Heavily influenced by the emergence of the IQ test during World War I for military testing [3], this perspective can lead to some dangerous conclusions (e.g. deciding that certain subpopulations lie within fixed intervals).

Under this model, mathematicians lie in interval above other mere mortals. They are "smarter" than the rest of us.

This definition of intelligence as a scalar is too limited. In fact, intelligence is a vector [2]. Some of us are highly intelligent interpersonally (so-called emotional IQ), artistically, and analytically. While mathematicians may rank high on the "analytic intelligence" dimension, speaking from personal experience, they are often low on the "emotional intelligence" dimension. 

## How to measure intelligence?
If we can't rank people based on a scalar quantity, how do we know who is smarter? My suspicion is that intelligence is not only a vector, but actually a function. That is, intelligence is an infinite-dimensional vector. I think each individual not only ranks different on each dimension, but also _includes intelligence dimensions specific to themselves_. The idea that there are a fixed number of ways that someone can demonstrate their smarts is ridiculous.
