<h2>Chapter 2: Exercises</h2>
<h4>Exercise 1</h4>
<p>
Suppose $f$ is a $2 \pi $-periodic and integrable function on any finite interval. Prove that if $ a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, then
\[
	\int_a^b f(x) = \int_{a + 2\pi}^{b + 2 \pi} f(x) = \int_{a - 2 \pi}^{b - 2 \pi} f(x).
\]

<!-- Article idea: mathematics and the mindset of extremism -->
Also prove that
\[
	\int_{- \pi}^\pi f(x + a) dx = \int_{- \pi}^\pi f(x) dx = \int_{-\pi + a}^{\pi + a} f(x) dx.
\]

<h4>Answer</h4>
Graphically, the first claim is obvious. Since the function itself is invariant under shifts of $2 \pi$, then the area under the curve must also be invariant under shifts of $2 \pi$. Consider the special case $f(x) = \sin(x)$ shown in the interactive diagram below. Drag $a$ and $b$ and observe how the area of the region under the curve stays constant.
<!-- TODO; insert an interactive graphic that allows the user to move the endpoints of the integration region and observe what happens to the area under the curve -->
We justify the first claim with two changes of variables: $x = x + 2 \pi$ and $x = x - 2 \pi$. The first change gives
\[
\int_a^b f(x)  dx = \int_{a + 2\pi}^{b + 2\pi} f(x - 2\pi) dx.
\]
The periodicity of $f$ gives $f(x - 2\pi) = f(x)$ so 
\[
	\int_a^b f(x) dx = \int_{a + 2 \pi}^{b + 2\pi} f(x) dx
\]
as desired. Similarly, we can deduce that
\[
	\int_a^b f(x) dx = \int_{a - 2 \pi}^{b - 2\pi} f(x).
\]

The second statement is not quite so clear. The following graphic shows that integrating from $- \pi + a$ to $\pi + a$ is the same as integrating from $-\pi$ to $\pi$ by periodicity. The shaded parts show the missing area when integrating over the two different intervals, but note that they are the same.
<!-- TODO: insert an interactive graphic that shows the two different areas -->
Symbolically, we can rewrite the integral as
\[
\int_{-\pi + a}^{\pi + a} f(x) dx  = \int_{-\pi + a}^\pi f(x)dx + \int_\pi^{\pi + a} f(x) dx.
\]
It then remains to show that
\[
	\int_\pi^{\pi + a} f(x) dx = \int_{-\pi}^{-\pi + a} f(x) dx.
\]
Using the first statement of the question with $a = -\pi$ and $b = -\pi + a$, we have as desired
\[
	\int_{-\pi}^{-\pi + a} f(x) dx = \int_\pi^{\pi + a} f(x) dx.
\]
