Why is math so useful? Many [people](https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html) have tried to answer this question. After only a year of graduate school, this short essay is my first attempt.

Math is effective because it describes only a tiny set of objects. This may be counter-intuitive. Aren't we told that "math is everywhere?" Isn't math limitless? 

In fact, math describes surprisingly simple objects. Take, for example, one of humankind's earliest mathematical insights: the natural numbers $1, 2, 3, \ldots$. Even zero was too complicated in the beginning. The number $1$ is a very simple object. We can add it and subtract it. That's it. But the number one represents enormous complexity. You could count one planet, one atom, one person, one concept, one automobile. That is, the plantonic number $1$ represents far more complicated objects.

The effectiveness of math is not intrinsic. Its effectiveness is due to human's ability to *figure out the simple stuff in complicated scenarios*. For example, the natural numbers come from the observation that the concept of "quantity" is independent of all the molecular complexity of an object. One bat is the same as one planet. 

Math then leverages our natural linguistic ability by building rules for manipulating mathematical objects. For the case of the natural numbers, each number $n$ is akin to a vocabulary word while addition is akin to forming sentences. 

You can say, "house built with a hammer." You have taken two vocabulary words "house" and "hammer" and generated a new statement by combining them with the verb built. This is akin to the mathematical "sentence" $1 + 2 = 3$. We have taken two mathematical "words" and combined them with the "verb" of adding.

This extends to the general structure of mathematics. Though most students don't see this structure in highschool, and even in college, math is essentially a language comprised of definitions and theorems. The definitions are the "vocabulary words" and the theorems are the "grammatical rules" for creating new sentences. Math thus exploits our amazing ability for language.

There are thus main reasons for the effectiveness of math:
1. Human beings can see simple stuff (patterns) in complicated scenarios. 
2. After observing patterns, we can generate linguistic rules to manipulate the patterns.

The complexitiy of math mirrors the complexity in human language: more sophisticated definitions lead to more powerful results. Take as an example the English word "good." As a vocabulary word, it encompasses a huge collection of concepts. Food is good, happiness is good, and being alive is good. Its lack of descriptive power has a downside: you can't make precise statements with it.

For example, you can't say "every good thing makes me happy." Getting your homework done is a good thing, but it usually doesn't make you happy. With a slightly more precise definition of good, we can make this stronger statement. Take for example the word "beautiful." Beautiful things are good. The sentence "every beautiful thing makes me happy" is more believable than the statement "every good thing makes me happy."

What's the point? By increasing the nuance of the word, we can make stronger statements via our grammatical rules. The same phenomena happens in mathematics. The natural numbers are like the word "good." They're useful, but too general for interesting results. For example, is there a natural number between $1$ and $2$? Of course not. We need a more nuanced definition of number.

Like replacing the word "good" with "beautiful," we can replace the natural numbers with fractions. Now, we can say that between any two fractions $a/b$ and $c/d$ there is another fraction. By adding more properties, we can make stronger statements about our obejcts.

In linguistics, the subtle differences in vocabulary words is built upon experience. A naive language learner might think: "oh, I'll just memorize all the words and the grammar rules, and then I can speak the language." Of course, this is impossible. You can only follow this strategy so far.

In the same way, many students start studying math by memorizing definitions and formula. This isn't their fault; this is how we teach math. This is even a problem at the graduate level.

Instead, just as you can only discern the difference between "beauty" and "goodness" through experience examples, you can only discern the difference between the natural numbers and fractions by examples.

The statement that "math is everywhere" is misleading. The correct statement is that "humans see patterns everywhere" and can reason about them with a complex language called mathematics. As to whether or not these patterns are realistic, that's another question.
