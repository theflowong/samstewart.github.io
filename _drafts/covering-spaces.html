	<h2>Why do we need covering spaces?</h2>
		
	<h2>What is a covering space?</h2>
	<!-- TODO: a covering space represents the symmetries of our base space. Equivalently, they describe various ways of "unwrapping" our space -->
	<p>
		There is a simple model we will use to motivate the definition of a covering space. If we convert $\R$ into a helix centered at $0$, then the vertical projection of a point gives a point on $S^1$ embedded in the plane. 
	</p>
	<!-- todo: show 3D plot of the helix and the projection -->
	<p>
		Intuitively, the larger object $\R$ lies above $S^1$ and collapses nicely to the circle. The definition of a covering space requires two different spaces: the covering space $E$, the base space $B$, and a map $p : E \to B$ relating the two spaces. The constraints shown in the above figure are thus really constraints on $p$ (see <a href="mapping_and_relative_definitions.html">relative definitions in mathematics</a>). 
	</p>
	<!-- article idea: the many faces of continuity -->
	<p>
		From our example, its clear that $E$ should completely cover $B$ and should locally preserve the topological structure of $B$ (no tearing). In other words, $p$ should be surjective and continuous. But a simple projection satisfies this definition; we want another constraint on the structure of the covering space $E$: we want $E$ to look like copies of $E$ glued nicely together. How do we capture this idea formally? We demand that the topology of $E$ is a set of copies of the topology of $B$. 
	</p>

	<p>
		More precisely, for $p \in B$, there must exist a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ such that $p^{-1}(U)$ is equal to a union of disjoint sets $V_\alpha$ open in $E$. Each $V_\alpha$ is a (maybe deformed) copy of $U$ in $E$. But we don't want mild deformation, so we also require that each $V_\alpha$ is homeomorphic to $U$ under $p$. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In the following interactive diagram, you can adjust the endpoints of the open neighborhood of $(1, 0)$ and see the corresponding lifted $V_\alpha$'s in $E$.
	</p>	
	<!-- insert interactive diagram showing how adjusting the interval leads to the neighborhoods upstairs adjusting -->
	
	<p>	
		Our precise definition is thus
		<div class="definition">
			Let $E$ and $B$ be topological spaces and $p : E \to B$ a continuous and surjective map between them. If for every $p \in B$ there is a neighborhood $U$ such that $p^{-1}(U)$ is the disjoint union of open sets $V_\alpha$ in $E$ and each $V_\alpha$ is homeomorphic to $E$ under $p$, then we say $p$ is a covering map and $E$ is a covering space for $B$.
		</div>
	</p>
	<h2>Products of covering maps</h2>
	<p>
		We can build covering maps of product spaces by simply covering each component space. As an example, consider $T^2 = S^1 \times S^1$ with the covering space $\R^2$ and covering map
		\[
			p(\theta, \phi) = (p_1(\theta), p_2(\phi))
		\]
		where $p_1, p_2$ are the covering map of $S^1$ by $\R$ that we discussed in the last section. Graphically, we can imagine the map as follows
		<!-- interactive diagram of imbedding of torus into 3 space with adjustable \theta and \phi -->
		
		In general, we have the following theorem.
	</p>
	<div class="theorem">
		Let $E_1, E_2$ be covering spaces for $B_1, B_2$ with corresponding covering maps $p_1, p_2$. Then $p : E_1 \times E_2 \to B_1 \times B_2$ defined by
		\[
			p(e_1, e_2) = (p_1(e_1), p(e_2))
		\] is a covering map so that $E_1 \times E_2$ is a covering space for $B_1 \times B_2$. 
	</div>
	
	<div class="proof">
		Coming soon.
	</div>

	There are a few other useful examples. We can construct a trivial covering space for any topological space $X$ by simply stacking copies of $X$ above itself.
	<!-- picture of stacked rectangles -->
	Formally, the space $X \times \{ 1, \ldots, n \}$ is a covering space of $X$ if imbued with the covering map $p(x, i) = x$. Of course, with $n = 1$, this implies that $X$ covers itself. 

	The second example is more complicated and is an application to complex analysis. In $\C$, the log function has a branch point at $z = 0$ where, if not properly restricted, the function is multivalued. However, if we change the domain to copies of $\C \ \{ \R^- \}$ glued together along $\R^-$ to form a helical cover of $\C$, then $\log(z)$ becomes analytic.
	<!-- insert helical cover of \C -->
		
	<h2>Are local homeomorphisms also covering maps?</h2>
	<p>
		We call a map $f : X \to Y$ a local homeomorphism if every point $p \in X$ has a neighborhood $U$ so that $f$ restricted to $U$ is a homeomorphism to $f(U)$. Every covering map $p : E \to B$ is a local homeomorphism. To see why, let $x \in E$. Then by definition of a covering space, the point $p(x)$ has a neighborhood $V$ in $B$ such that $p^{-1}(V)$ is a disjoint union of open $U_\alpha$ which are individually homeomorphic to $V$. One of the $U_\alpha$'s must contain $x$, so we are done.
	</p>

	<p>
		On the other hand, not every local homeomorphism is a covering map. In some sense, a covering map is a collection of local homeomorphisms. As a counter example, consider again the covering map
		\[
			p(\theta) = (\cos(2 \pi \theta), \sin (2 \pi \theta))
		\]
		of $S^1$ by $\R$. If we restrict this to $\R^+$, then we still have a local homeomorphism, but not a covering map. The following diagram shows the problem
	</p>

	<!-- interactive diagram with problem at 0 -->
	<p>
		The issue is the pre-image set $(0, \epsilon)$. It's locally homeomorphic to its image, but under $p$ is not homeomorphic to the full colored set $U$; it is merely an imbedding.
	</p>
	<h2>What is the difference between a quotient and covering space?</h2>
	<p>
	The ideas are similar: both involve collapsing a larger object onto a smaller, and both ideas have similar definitions: both involve maps.
