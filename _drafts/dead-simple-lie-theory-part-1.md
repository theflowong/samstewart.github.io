# Reducing a Problem
At the heart of Lie theory, like most topics in mathematics, is a simple idea: we can use the symmetries of a complex object to reduce the complex object to a much simpler one. In Lie theory, the complicated objects are Lie groups, and the simpler objects are the corresponding Lie algebras. Lie groups are manifolds and thus "curvy" while Lie algebras are vector spaces and thus linear or "flat." Studying linear objects is always easier than nonlinear.

Let's start with the more complicated object: a Lie group. The circle is a Lie group when viewed as a sub-manifold of $\C$.

What is a Lie group?
1. A group
2. A manifold

Is $S^1$ a manifold? Absolutely, and there are many ways to prove this.

Is $S^1$ a group? Sure. If $z_1 = e^{2\pi \theta_1}, z_2 = e^{2\pi \theta_2} \in S^1$, then $z_1 \cdot z_2 = e^{2\pi (\theta_1 + \theta_2)}$. So the group structure is angle addition.

A general manifold is too complicated. But the additional group structure produces a lot of symmetries. Here, the group structure corresponds to a rotational symmetry. Since the Lie group is closed under angle addition, than adding $\theta$ to every angle simply permutes the elements of the group. Equivalently, rotating by $\theta$ maps $S^1$ to $S^1$.

In differential geometry, we can linearize an arbitrary manifold at each point via the tangent space. But the problem is that the tangent spaces are unrelated. If we
