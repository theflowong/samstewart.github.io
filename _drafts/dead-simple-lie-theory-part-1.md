## What is a Lie group?
At the heart of Lie theory, like most topics in mathematics, is a simple idea: we can use the symmetries of a complex object to reduce the complex object to a much simpler one. In Lie theory, the complicated objects are Lie groups, and the simpler objects are the corresponding Lie algebras. Lie groups are manifolds and thus "curvy" while Lie algebras are vector spaces and thus linear or "flat." Studying linear objects is always easier than nonlinear.

Let's start with the more complicated object: a Lie group. In this article, we will use the unit circle in the complex plane as a model for our description of Lie theory. 

In the complex plane, [we know that multiplication is rotation](the-geometry-of-complex-numbers). On the unit circle, multiplication of two numbers thus stays within the circle since their angles simply add. Thus, either as adding angles or as multiplying complex numbers, the circle in the complex plane is a group (i.e. you can add elements together and every element has a negative).

But the circle also is a geometric object with nice properties (we call it a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold). 

Together these two properties, group structure and geometric structure, makes the circle into an object called a Lie group (named after the great 19th-century mathematician [Sophus Lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophus_Lie)). 

So multiplying two numbers on the unit circle produces a third number on the unit circle. This is the group structure. In fact, if we multiply *every* complex number on the unit circle by a *fixed* complex number, then we have rotated *every* number on the unit circle. In other words, we have rotated the unit circle!

The point is that the symmetry of the circle leads to a connection between the *geometric* structure  of the circle (i.e. it is rotationally symmetric) and the *group* structure of the circle (i.e. multiplying two complex numbers produces a third one still on the unit circle).


## The Importance of the Identity
Every group has an identity element. In the real numbers with multiplication it is $1$.
