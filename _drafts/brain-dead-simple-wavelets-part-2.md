# Why do we want a continuous wavelet?

# Constructing a continuous wavelet
A first attempt at continuous wavelet might be to smooth the Haar wavelet

( picture of smoothed Haar wavelet in physical and Fourier space )

Unfortunately, we can lose orthogonality across different scales with this approach so we need to contrain our search a bit more.
