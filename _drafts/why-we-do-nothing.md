Outline:

	Shadows and reality
	The "right perspective"

Problem in the sciences
	Life Sciences
		Modeling of natural behaviors
	Economics
		Theorem of compactness
		Much of financial modeling [cite Physics of Wall Street]
	Basic science better than sophisticated models
		Anecdote about Tuan asking "where the math is"

Problem in teaching
	Distill into easily digestible "theorems"
Distinction between deduced and received knowledge

What is a theorem?
	A novel statement that encompasses many special cases
	Ex: theorem of compactness

What is an application?
	A particular situation that satisfies the hypotheses of a given theorem
	Ex: economics, price of a good in a market has a maximum

Summary: why distinguish?
	The overall goal of math is to keep knowledge organized well. You need to separate levels of abstraction so that you don't repeat work. 

	==================

Plato offers the analogy of prisoners in a cave who can only see their own shadows and not reality. This distinction between "shadows" and "reality" is a common theme in mathematics: mathematicians wish to find the proper perspective on a problem that banishes the shadows and reveals reality. That is, the proper "lighting" often almost forces the correct solution.

Misunderstanding this goal produces many problems in fields that use mathematics. In my experience, the biggest problem is **confusing a theorem with its applications**. As an example,
