In Richard Dawkin's *Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing* an article by Erwin Schrodinger captures the reason why we struggle to be proactive:

"What is the characteristic feature of life?...When a system that is not alive is isolated or placed in a uniform environment...A permanent state is reached, in which no observable events occur. The physicist calls this the state of thermodynamical equilibrium, or of 'maximum entropy'" [4, p. 381]

Essentially, being proactive means continually fighting against the desire to fall into an equilibrium state where we are no longer fighting the descent of life into maximum entropy, or chaos.

# Professionally
In graduate school, no one tells you what to do. While this may sound fantastic initially, one quickly realizes that this can quickly cascade into inertia, lack of motivation, and in the worst case, depression.

# Personally
Anything worth having takes time and effort. Interpersonal relationships are no different. Organizing fun activities with friends and meeting new people takes planning and commitment.

Interacting with friends outside of work requires overcoming three barriers:
1. Natural inertia against doing *anything*
2. The ease with which technology can replace real interactions (for more on this, see [1], [2])
3. The cultural barrier of socializing in large groups (see [3])
