% Future directions:
%	Can the blowup for our equation be translated into blowup for Euler?
%	
% Questions for Sverak:
% 1. How could we use this model to generate blowup for Euler 3D? [Behavior near the axis)
% 2. If we can rule out such a singularity near the boundary for Navier Stokes, then what is the point of this? (still break down of Newtonian physics. Superfluid)
% 3. Why do we flip the velocity field in the initial configuration? (best configuration for generating blowup)
% 4. Why does he expect a singularity at the center point (you expect shock formation)
% 5. Why don't we care about Burger's equation? (we do. it's a good 1d model. Read Constantine-Lax 2003 paper)
% 6. Is there something special about the 1D equation that we hope will connect the blowup to the 2D equation?
%	No, actually closer to 3D equation.
% 7. Why isn't there a canonical choice?
%	Hard to decide what to model.
% 8. Can we add some kind of physical explanation for our 1D results? For example, why do we expect the first derivative where the vorticity is zero to be conserved?
% 9. Why this no flux condition? [ exactly why Navier stokes doesn't have blowup near the boundary)
% 10. Why is vorticity so important? How is it related to electromagnitism?
% 11. What is the hyperbolic blowup scenario?
% 12. How do we choose these Biot-Savart laws? [ Described later in Sverak's paper ]

% After discussiong with Sverak
% Future goals:
% 1. Global stability for De Gregorio
% 2. Link to axis-symmetric flow in full 3D euler (with swirl) 
% 3. Perhaps explore Boussinque 1D model for full 2D blowup

% Boussinique flow has singularity at the boudnary from axis symmetric case. The boundary is closed, so we can model it with a 1D equation quite accurately.
% Good motivating papers: http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~const/eule.pdf
% De Gregorio's motivating paper
% Constantine-Lax-Majda 1D model (2003). De Gregorio is essentially a regularization of this
% w_t + u w_x = 0 regular transport
% 1d Boussinique flow (has blowup?)
% De Gregorio (vorticity transported as a vector, not as a scalar)

% Vorticity transported as scalar for 2D (hence regularity) while vorticity is transported as vector in 3D. From this perspective, De Gregorio tells us 3D flow might be regular.

% the addition of teh transport term w_x u seems to add some kind of regularization effect.

% we can prove rigorously our local stability, and have numerically global attractor. There is a gap here and I plan to close it	
% what we have
%	Linear stability
% what we don't have
% 	nonlinear stability
%	global attractor (not even preventing blowup)

% what is Euler equations with flow?
Blowup of solutions from smooth initial data for Navier-Stokes is quite literally ``a million-dollar question'' according to the Clay Institute [cite]. A related problem is the existence of blowup solutions to the Euler equations. Despite the unrealistic lack of viscosity, a blowup solution to Euler equations would already be evidence that the current models are insufficient.

One potential approach, which dates at least back to Burgers [cite], is to study 1D model equations. A simple beginning is a 1D model for 2D Euler studied by Constantin et el [cite]. Written with $\omega$ as vorticity and $u$ as velocity, we have
\begin{equation}
	\omega_t = u_x \omega
	\label{eq:constantin}
\end{equation}
with the Biot-Savart law $u_x = H \omega$ where $H$ is the Hilbert transform. The authors exhibited solutions that blowup in finite time. A more complicated example is a model of 2D Boussinesq flow. The 2D Boussinesq system represents a flow in the half-plane that is similar to axi-symmetric 3D Euler. Numerical evidence suggests a singularity near the boundary of 2D Boussinesq flow, but a rigorous justification has been difficult [cite]. A possible 1D model at the boundary is given by 
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\omega_t + u \omega_x &= \theta_x \cr
		\theta_t + u \theta_x &= 0
	\end{aligned}
	\label{eq:boussinisq_system}
\end{equation}
with the same Biot-Savart law $u_x = H \omega$ as before but with $\theta$ representing temperature. Sverak et el followed numerical evidence and discovered blowup solutions. 

The model equation we studied is somehow between the above two models. Our equation, first discussed by De Gregorio [3], is the same as (\ref{eq:constantin}) except for the addition of the transport term $u \omega_x$. In vorticity form the equation is given by 
\begin{equation}
	\omega_t + u \omega_x = u_x \omega, \quad u_x = H \omega
	\label{eq:degregorio}
\end{equation}
on the 1D torus. The question of blowup has been open since 1990 [cite]. 

When written with the Lie bracket, 
\[
	\omega_t + [u, \omega] = 0,
\]
one can see that $\omega$ is now transported as a one dimensional \textit{vector}. This contrasts its transport as a \textit{scalar} in (\ref{eq:constantin}). This distinction, as in the case of 2D and 3D Euler, suggests a difference in regularity of the solutions. Solutions to (\ref{eq:constantin}) blow up in finite time, but perhaps solutions to (\ref{eq:degregorio}) stay bounded.

Professor Sverak, Professor Hao Jia, and I have developed numerical and theoretical evidence that suggests solutions to (\ref{eq:degregorio}) do not blow up. Somehow, adding the convection term to (\ref{eq:majda_model}) regularizes the solution. I wrote a spectral solver to gain intuition about the behavior of solutions before we began working on the theory. From the numerics, it appears that there are two global attractors: $\sin x$ and $\cos x$. Thus far, we have managed to prove local linear stability of these equilibria and are preparing our paper for publication. Already the results are exciting since we are one step closer to eliminating blowup solutions. 

This project has sparked my interest in 1D model equations for the Euler equations. My goal is first to understand (\ref{eq:degregorio}) better. To prove local stability, we have observed that solutions to the linearized equation are complex analytic, allowing us to complexify the problem and apply complex ODE theory to rule out discrete spectra, and hence periodic solutions. Moving to nonlinear stability is more difficult, but a perturbative approach might work.

% Ask Vladimir about global stability

There is a connection between (\ref{eq:degregorio}) and behavior of axi-symmetric 3D Euler with swirl away from the axis. Lack of blowup solutions might suggest that 3D Euler behaves nicely away from the axis. I plan to explore this connection more rigorously.

\textbf{Broader Impact}
We interact with fluids daily but it is easy to overlook their beautiful complexity. Wanting to share my excitement, I have found two novel ways to impact the general public. First, I have arranged to give a talk at Cafe Scientifique about fluid dynamics. Cafe Scientifique is a nation-wide program that hosts scientists for outreach to the general public. The local chapter in Minneapolis is hosted in Bryant Lake-Bowl Theatre, a local bar and bowling alley. I will be the first mathematician giving a presentation. I am working hard to make my presentation accessible and entertaining to nonspecialists by collaborating with a fellow graduate student who studied theatre in college. 

Wanting to impact audiences beyond Minneapolis, I have also written a solver for 2D Navier-Stokes in JavaScript and WebGL and posted it on my blog. Due to recent advances in graphics cards, realtime fluid simulation in the web browser is now possible. The simulator allows the user to play with a two dimensional viscous fluid directly in their web browser, without the need for additional plugins. Even six years ago this would have been impossible. 

\textbf{Intellectual Merit}
Having taken a year long PDE course, a year long fluids course, and passing all the preliminary exams, I am prepared to tackle this project. This semester I am taking a dynamical systems course, a harmonic analysis course, and have am reading functional analysis and spectral theory with a graduate student at University of Illinois. I have begun learning about numerical methods for fluids by writing a web based fluid solver.
