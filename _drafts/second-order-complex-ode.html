	<h2>Introduction</h2>
We discuss solutions to the following general ODE
\[
	f''(z) + p_1(z) f'(z) + p_0(z) f(z) = 0,
\]
where $p_1, p_0$ are meromorphic functions at $z = a$. As our motivating example, we will consider Bessel's equation
\[
	<!-- TODO: insert Bessel's equation -->
\]

	<h2>Ordinary points</h2>
	We call $z = a$ an ordinary point if $p_1(a)$ and $p_0(a)$ are analytic at $z = a$. In this case, we have the following theorem that guarantees local existence of an analytic solution.

	\begin{theorem}[Local Existence Theorem]

	\end{theorem}

	<h2>Singular Points</h2>
	We call $z = a$ a singular point if either $p_1(a)$ or $p_0(a)$ is <em>not</em> analytic at $a$. However, there are relatively "good" singular points, that we call <em>regular</em> singular points. Here $p_1(a)$ has a pole of order $1$ while $p_0(a)$ has a pole of order at most $2$. Finally, we call a point $z = a$ irregular if it is neither ordinary nor regular.
