						Let $U = \{ (x, y) \in \R^2 \mid x &lt;  1 \}$ and $V = \{ (x, y) \in \R^2 \mid x &gt; -1 \}$. Then $U \cap V = \{ (x, y) \mid x \in [-1, 1] \}$. One can show that $U$ and $V$ are homeomorphic to $\R^2 \backslash \{ (0, 0) \}$. By constructing a deformation retract from $\R^2 \backslash \{ (0, 0) \}$ to $S^1$, we can see that

							\pi_1($\R^2 \backslash \{ (0, 0) \}$) = \pi_1(S^1) = \Z.

						Thus, $\pi_1(U) = \pi_1(V) = \Z$. Since $U \cap V$ is a convex set in $\R^2$, it is simply connected. Hence, in the statement of Van Kampen's Theorem, we have $N = 1$. Hence we can conclude from Van Kampen's Theorem that

				<div class="main_idea">
					See <a href="how_to_classify_the_symmetries_of_an_object.html">how to classify the symmetries of an object</a>.

				<div class="formalism">

					There are two statements of the theorem. We offer the simpler one below.
					<div class="definition">
						We say a space $X$ is path connected if between any two points $a, b$ there exists a path $\gamma$ such that $\gamma(0) = a$ and $\gamma(1) = b$.

						We say a space $X$ is locally path connected if for point $p \in X$ and neighborhood $U$ of $p$, there exists a smaller neighborhood $V$ such that $V$ is path connected.

						<p>
						Note: due to annoying naming conventions, path connected does not imply locally path connected. Consider the comb space. Let $K = \{ 1/ n \mid n \in \Nn \}$. Then
						\[
							X = \{ 0 \} \times [0, 1] \cup [0, 1] \times \{0 \} \cup K \times [0, 1]
						\]
						with the subspace topology inherited from $\R^2$. The space is path connected, but is not locally path connected on the vertical line at the origin.

					<div class="theorem">
						Let $X$ be a path-connected, locally path-connected, and semi-locally path connected. There is a bijection between basepoint preserving isomorphism classes of connected covering spaces and subgroups of $\pi_1(X, x_0)$.

					<em>Statement 2</em>
					<div class="theorem">

				<div class="main_idea">
					<!-- insert explanation with what the group X might be -->
					Just count the number of subgroups of $\pi_1(X, x_0) = \Z / 2 \times \Z / 4$.
				</div>

				<div class="formalism">
					<p>
					Since $\pi_1(X, x_)$ is abelian, we can use either version of the classification theorem stated above since each conjugacy class contains only one subgroup. Using the first statement, we need only count the number of subgroups of $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ to find the number of basepoint-preserving isomorphism classes of connected covering spaces. Note that in the group $G_1 \times G_2$, the subgroups are precisely of the form $H_1 \times H_2$ where $H_1 \leq G_1$ and $H_2 \leq G_2$. 
					</p>

					<p>
					The subgroups of $\Z / 2$ are $0, \Z / 2$ and the subgroups of $\Z / 4$ are $0, \Z / 2,  \Z / 4$. Hence, our complete list of subgroups is
					\[
						\begin{aligned}
							\Z / 2 \times 0 \cr
							0 \times 0 \cr
							\Z / 2 \times \Z / 2 \cr
							0 \times \Z / 2 \cr
							\Z /2 \times \Z / 4 \cr
							0 \times \Z / 4

					There are six total subgroups, so we conclude that there are six isomorphism classes of connected covering spaces.

					The real line with two origins, call this $X$, with the map $f : X \to \R$ that sends both origins to $0$ and sends everything else to itself.

						Consider the real line with two origins constructed as follows. Let

							X = \R \times \{ a \} \coprod \R \times \{ b \}
						\]
						with the equivalence relation that $(x, a) \sim (x, b)$ iff $x \neq 0$ and the quotient topology. Then consider the map
						\[
							f : \R \times \{ a \} \coprod \R \times \{ b \} \to \R
						\]
						given by
						\[
							f((x,y)) = x 
						\]
						This map respects the equivalence relation so it induces a map on $X$ to $\R$. It is clearly a local homeomorphism away from the two origins $0_a, 0_b$. At $0_a$, choose the neighborhood $(-1, 1) \times \{ a\}$. This maps homeomorphically to $(-1, 1)$. Repeat the same for $0_b$. 
						</p>
						<p>
						However, the map is not a covering map since the pre-image of $0$ cannot be partitioned into two disjoint open sets. Assume for the sake of contradiction that $U$ is a neighborhood of $0$ such that $f^{-1}(U) = V_1 \cup V_2$ where $V_1, V_2$ are disjoint. By definition of $f$, we know that $0_a \in V_1$ and $0_b \in V_2$. By definition of the equivalence relation, we have that $V_1 \backslash \{ a \} \cap V_2 \backslash \{ b \} \neq \emptyset$. Thus, $V_1$ and $V_2$ are not disjoint, a contradiction.

				Calculate the homology groups of the torus $S^1 \times S^1$.
			</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				<div class="main_idea">
					See <a href="what_is_homology.html">what is homology?</a>. Build the torus from one $0$-simplex, three $1$-simplices, and two $2$-simplices as follows
					<!-- insert diagram of simplicial complex of the torus. Label the vertices.-->
					The first homology group $H_0 = \Z$ since the space is connected. Since the torus is path connected, then $H_1 = \pi_1 = \Z \times \Z = \Z \oplus \Z$. Finally, we have $H_2 = \langle \lambda_1 - \lambda_2 \rangle / \langle 0 \rangle = \Z$. Hence, the homology is
				       \[
			       			H_k(T) = \begin{cases}
				 			\Z & \textrm{ if } k = 0, 2 \cr		
							\Z \oplus \Z & \textrm { if } k = 1
							\end{cases}
					\]
				</div>

				<div class="formalism">
					We present arguments varying in computation and abstraction.
					<h3>Computation from definitions alone (simple)</h3>
					From first definitions alone we can compute the homology group. We start by computing the kernels and images of the boundary maps.
					\[
						\begin{aligned}
							\textrm{ker } \partial_0 &= \Z \cr	
							\textrm{img } \partial_0 &= 0 \cr	
							\textrm{ker } \partial_1 &= \langle a, b, c \rangle \cr	
							\textrm{img } \partial_1 &= \langle 0 \rangle \cr
							\textrm{ker } \partial_2 &= \langle \lambda_1 - \lambda_2 \rangle \cr	
							\textrm{img } \partial_2 &= \langle a + b - c\rangle 	 \cr
							\textrm{ker } \partial_3 &= 0 \cr	
							\textrm{img } \partial_3 &= 0\rangle 	
	
						\end{aligned}
					\]
					Note that $\textrm{ker } \partial_2$ because
					\[
						\partial_2(p \lambda_1 + q \lambda_2) = (p + q)(a + b - c) = 0.
					\]
					Since $a + b - c$ is a element of the basis $\{ a, b, a + b - c \}$ for $C_1$, then $p + q = 0$ so $p = -q$.	
					With this information we can compute the homology groups as follows
					\[
						\begin{aligned}
						H_0 &= \frac{\Z}{0} = \Z \cr
						H_1 &= \frac{\textrm{ker } \partial_1}{\textrm{img } \partial_2} = \frac{\langle a, b, c \rangle}{\langle a + b - c \rangle} = \Z \oplus \Z \oplus \Z / \Z = \Z \oplus \Z \cr
						H_2 &= \frac{\textrm{ker } \partial_2}{\textrm{img } \partial_3} = \frac{\langle \lambda_1 - \lambda_2 \rangle}{0} = \Z
						\end{aligned}		
					\]
					Thus, the homology of the torus is
				        \[
			       			H_k(T) = \begin{cases}
				 			\Z & \textrm{ if } k = 0, 2 \cr		
							\Z \oplus \Z & \textrm { if } k = 1
							\end{cases}
					\]
					<h3>Computation with two tools (simpler)</h3>
					<p>
					First, note that $T^2$ is a connected space. A general fact implies that $H_0(T^2) = \Z$. Then note that $\pi_1(T^2, x_0) = \Z \oplus \Z$. Another general fact tells us that for any path-connected topological space $X$, we have $H_1(X) = \pi_1(X, x_0) / \langle aba^{-1}b^{-1} \rangle$ (i.e. $H_1(X)$ is the abelianization of $\pi_1(X, x_0))$. Thus $H_1(T^2) = \pi_1(T^2, x_0) = \Z \oplus \Z$. 
					</p>
					<p>	
					For $k &gt; 2$, note that $H_k(T^2) = 0$ since the highest dimensional complex is a $2$-complex, so the higher chain groups vanish. By definition, this implies that
					\[
					H_2(T^2) = \frac{\textrm{ker } \partial_2}{\textrm{im } \partial 3} =\frac{\textrm{ker } \partial_2}{0} = \textrm{ker } \partial_2
					\]
					Notice that the two simplices $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$ used in the complex for $T^2$ share a common boundary, so they both map to the same $1$-cycle under $\partial_2$. In general, if two vectors map to the same thing under a linear map, their difference is in the kernel. Hence $\textrm{ker }\partial_2 = \langle \lambda_1 - \lambda_2 \rangle$.
					</p>
					<p>
					As in the previous computation, we have thus concluded that
				        \[
			       			H_k(T) = \begin{cases}
				 			\Z & \textrm{ if } k = 0, 2 \cr		
							\Z \oplus \Z & \textrm { if } k = 1
							\end{cases}
					\]
					</p>
					<h3>Computation with three tools (simplest)</h3>
					<p>
					As above, since $T^2$ is connected and $\pi_1(T^2, x_0) = \Z \oplus \Z$, we have that $H_0(T^2) = \Z$ and $H_1(T^2) = \pi_1(T^2, x_0) = \Z \oplus \Z$. In general, if $X$ is a smooth, compact, connected, orientable $n$-manifold, without boundary, then the top homology is $H_n(X) = \Z$. So for the torus, which satisfies these hypotheses, we have $H_2(T^2) = \Z$. The higher homology groups vanish because the higher chain groups vanish.

			</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				<div class="main_idea">
					If such a map existed, then $r$ would be a retract from $D^n$ to $S^{n-1}$ which is unlikely. In the special case of $D^2$ to $S^1$, the problem is clear. The disk $D^2$ is simply connected while $S^1$ is not. The retraction includes $\pi_1(S^1) = \Z$ into $\pi_1(D^2) = 1$ which is impossible.

					The problem is that we cannot deform the space $D^2$ to $S^1$ without tearing it since $S^1$ has a hole while $D^2$ does not.

					</div>
					<div class="proof">
						<p>
						Assume towards a contradiction that there is a retraction $r : D^n \to S^{n - 1}$. Then we know that $r \circ i = \textrm{id}$ induces homomorphisms

					       		(r \circ i)^* = r^* \circ i^* = \textrm{id}_{H_k(S^n)}
						\]
						so we have the following exact chain sequence
						<!-- exact sequence diagram connecting H_{n - 1}(S^{n- 1} \to H_{n-1}(D^n) \to H_{n - 1}(S^{n-1} -->
						If $n &gt; 1$, then the composition $r^* \circ i^*$ cannot be equal to the identity because it factors through $H_{n - 1}(D^n) = 0$ with $H_{n - 1}(S^{n - 1}) = \Z$. If $n = 1$, then $r^* \circ i^*$ cannot be equal to the identity because it factors through $H_0(D^1) = \Z$ and $H_0(S^0) = \Z \plus \Z$. This implies that $r^*$ is not surjective, so the composition $r^* \circ i^*$ cannot be the identity.

					We offer two smooth atlases. The second is due to Erik Stuky (citation needed).
					</p>
					This example is a prototypical manifold. Break $S^1$ into four disjoint sets. Then define each chart to project these sets to the axes. One can verify this is indeed a smooth atlas. 
					<div class="figure">

					Imagine the circle embedded in $\C$. Cover the circle in two open sets $E$ (east) and $W$ (west). The set $E$ covers everything except $(-1, 0)$ and the set $W$ covers everything except $(1, 0)$. 
					<div class="figure">
					<!-- picture of the two coverings of S^1 -->
					</div>
					Now consider two branch cuts of the argument function. The first function, call it $\textrm{arg}_E(e^{i \theta}) = \theta$, corresonds to a cut along the non-negative real axis. Thus $\theta \in (-\pi, \pi)$. The second function, call it $\textrm{arg}_W(e^{i \theta}) = \theta$, corresponds to a cut along the non-positive real axis. Thus $\theta \in (0, 2\pi)$. These are the charts for our manifold and one can verify that they form a smooth atlas.

					We will construct two smooth atlases on $S^1$.
					</p>

					<p>
					The first atlas consists of four charts, but the charts are simply projections.	Using the immersion $F(\theta) = (\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$ for $\theta \in [0, 2\pi]$, define the following open sets
					\[
						\begin{aligned}
							U_1 &= \{ F(\theta) \mid \theta \in (0, \pi) \}	\cr
							U_2 &= \{ F(\theta) \mid \theta \in (-\pi, 0) \} \cr
							U_3 &= \{ F(\theta) \mid \theta \in (-\pi / 2, \pi / 2) \} \cr
							U_4 &= \{ F(\theta) \mid \theta \in (\pi / 2, 3 \pi / 2) \}
						\end{aligned}
					\]
					along with the following charts to $\R$
					\[
						\begin{aligned}
							\pi_1 &= \{ x \mid (x, y) \in U_1\}	\cr
							\pi_2 &= \{ x \mid (x, y) \in U_2\}	\cr
							\pi_3 &= \{ y \mid (x, y) \in U_3\}	\cr
							\pi_4 &= \{ y \mid (x, y) \in U_4\}
						\end{aligned}
					\]
					Without loss of generality, consider the first quadrant. Then $\pi_1$ is a homemorphism from $U_1$ to $(-1, 1)$ since it is continuous and a bijection. To check that the atlas consisting of these charts is smooth, we will consider $\pi_1 \circ \pi_3^{-1}$, check that it is smooth from $\theta \in (0, \pi/2)$ to $(0, 1)$ and then handle the remaining combinations by symmetry.
					</p>	

					<p>
					By definition $\pi_3^{-1}(y) = (\cos \arcsin y, y) $ for $y \in (-1, 1)$
					\[
						(\pi_1 \circ \pi_3^{-1})(y) = \cos \arcsin y
					\]
					which is smooth since both $\cos$ and $\arcsin$ are smooth for the appropriate domains. The remaining overlaps can be handled by symmetry. 
					</p>

					<p>
					The second atlas consists of only two charts, but requires some results from complex analysis. Embed $S^1$ into $\C$ and cover $S^1$ with two sets, $E = \S^1 \backslash -1$ and $W = \S^1 \backlash 1$. Then take two branch cuts of the argument function, call them $\textrm{arg}_E$ and $\textrm{arg}_W$ corresponding to $\C \backlash \R^-$ and $\C \backslash \R^+$.

			<p>
				<div class="main_idea">
					The map $F(\theta) = (\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$ from $\R$ into $\R^2$ is an immersion because the dimension of the tangent space is preserved at every point. It's not an embedding because $2\pi \Z$ go to the same point.
					<!-- insert graphic with unit arrow on real line. user's mouse moves and the tangent vector moves on S^1-->
				</div>

				<div class="formalism">
					<div class="proof">
						Let $F : \R  \to \R^2$ be the map $F(\theta) = (\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$. Clearly $F$ is smooth, so it remains to check that $dF$ is injective. Computation gives 
						\[
							dF = \nabla F = 
							\begin{bmatrix}
								-\sin \theta \cr
								\cos \theta
							\end{bmatrix}
						\]
						This map $dF$ has full rank if and only if it is not zero. Since $\sin$ and $\cos$ are phase shifts of each other, they have no common roots. Thus $dF$ has full rank for every $\theta$. We have shown that $F$ is an immersion. But since $F(2\pi \Z) = (1, 0)$ we see that $F$ is not an embedding.

								\end{bmatrix}.
						\]
						To determine the rank of this matrix, we can find the dimension of the column or the row space. In this case, the row space is simpler. The two rows are linearly dependent precisely when the top row is a multiple o the bottom row. Equivalently, when $(x,y,z)$ lie on the line spanned by $(0, 1/2, -1)$. Thus, $df$ is surjective on precisely the complement of this set, namely $\R^2 \backslash \textrm{span} \; (0, 1/2, -1)$.

					You should read <a href="what_is_the_lie_bracket.html">what is the Lie bracket</a> and <a href="what_does_frobenius_theorem_say.html">what does the Frobenius theorem say</a>. For this problem, we are looking for a two dimensional surface that has tangent vectors $X = \partial_x + y \partial_y + 2(x + y^2) \partial_z, Y = \partial_y + 2y \partial_z$ at every point. As described in the above article on the Frobenius theorem, this means we need $[X_p, Y_p] \in \textrm{span } (X_p, Y_p)$. Computation in coordinates via
					\[
						[X, Y] = (X \, Y^i - Y \, X^i)\partial_{x^i}
					\]
					gives
					\[
						[X, Y] = -Y
					\]
					which is in the span of $X, Y$. Since $X, Y$ always form a basis of $\R^2$, they form a tangent distribution (see <a href="tangent_distribution.html">tangent distribution</a>), in fact an <em>involutive</em> distrubtion. By Frobenius' theorem, the involutive distributions precisely characterize the completely integrable surfaces. Hence, the answer to the original question is yes.

					Since $X = \partial_x + y \partial_y + 2(x + y^2) \partial_z, Y = \partial_y + 2y \partial_z$ form a basis for an affine two-dimensional subspace at every point, they describe a tangent distribution $D$. To see that an integral surface exists, by Frobenius' theorem it suffices to check that $D$ is involutive.
					</p>

					<p>
					In coordinates the Lie bracket is given by
					\[
						[X, Y] = (X \, Y^i - Y \, X^i)\partial_{x^i} = X \, Y^i \partial_{x^i} - Y \, X^i \partial_{x^i}.
					\]
					Our computation is thus
					\[
						\begin{aligned}
							[X,Y] &= (X(0)\partial_x + X(1) \partial_y + X(2y)\partial_z) - (Y(1)\partial_X + Y(y)\partial_y + Y(2(x + y^2))) \partial_z \cr
							&= 0 + 0 + 2y\partial_z - (0 + \partial_y + 4y\partial_z) \cr
							&= - \partial_y - 2y\partial_z \cr
							&= -Y
						\end{aligned}

					Hence, $D$ is involutive so there exists an integral surface.
