Consider the smooth function $f : \R^2 \to \R^+$ given by $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$.

Pre-images of points in $\R^+$ are precisely circles of a given radius. For example, the set $f^{-1}(\Z)$ is

The differential of $f$ is simply the gradient $\nabla f = (2x, 2y)$. The implicit function theorem tells us that $f^{-1}(r)$ is a manifold when $\nabla f \neq 0$. Since $\nabla f = 0$ only at $r = 0$, then one can see that most values of $r$ give pre-images which are manifolds.

Sards' theorem tells us that this holds in general. If $f : \R^2 \to \R$ is a smooth function, then excepting a set of measure zero, for any $x \in \R$, we have that $f^{-1}(x)$ is a submanifold of $\R^2$.

We call the points where $f^{-1}(x)$ is not a manifold critical <em>values</em> and the points <em>in</em> the preimage critical <em>points</em>. The distinction is important because while there are few critical values, there can be many critical points. As an example, consider the smoothed step function $f: \R \to \R$

The derivative $f'$ is zero for most of the positive axis and zero for most of the negative axis. Hence, these
