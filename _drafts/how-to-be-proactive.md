Reading Richard Dawkin's Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing, I stumbled upon an article by ?? that perfectly captured the reason why we aren't proactive.

Quote from Dawkin's collection of great science writing.

Essentially, the problem is that we must fight continually to make order out of noise, both in our professional and personal lives.

# Professionally
In graduate school, no one tells you what to do. While this may sound fantastic initially, one quickly realizes that this can quickly cascade into inertia, lack of motivation, and in the worst case, depression.

# Personally
Anything worth having takes time and effort. Interpersonal relationships are no different. Organizing fun activities with friends and meeting new people takes planning and commitment.

Interacting with friends outside of work requires overcoming three barriers:
1. Natural inertia against doing *anything*
2. The ease with which technology can replace real interactions (for more on this, see [1], [2])
3. The cultural barrier of socializing in large groups (see [3])

[1] Alone Together
[2] Disconnected
[3] Bowling Alone
